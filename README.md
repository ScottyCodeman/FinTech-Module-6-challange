# San Francisco Housing

## My challenge was to provide analysis of the San Francisco Housing market for the company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing

## using hvplot I took the data from csv files on rental prices, the sale price per square foot, and the amount of housing units in each neighbourhood.

## First I looked at the amount of housing markets over the years
